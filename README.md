# LightGlue-ALIKED-FeatureMatcher-OpenCV-GSoC2025
GSoC 2025 proposal project: Integrating LightGlue as a matcher and ALIKED as a feature detector in OpenCV, with subpixel accurate keypoint refinement.
---

## 📌 Project Title  
**LightGlue Matcher with ALIKED Feature Integration in OpenCV**

---

## 📄 Abstract  
The goal of this project is to integrate the LightGlue feature matcher and ALIKED feature descriptor into the OpenCV library. This also includes implementing subpixel accurate keypoint refinement using the keypt2subpx method. These enhancements will improve OpenCV’s feature matching capabilities, especially in real-world, noisy, or complex visual environments.

---

## ✅ Deliverables
- Integration of LightGlue as a feature matcher.
- Integration of ALIKED as a DNN-based feature detector/descriptor.
- Implementation of keypt2subpx for subpixel keypoint refinement.
- Sample scripts demonstrating robust matching performance.
- Documentation and test cases for each component.

---

## 📁 Repository Structure (Planned)
- `examples/` – usage and demo scripts  
- `models/` – pre-trained ALIKED model files  
- `lightglue/` – LightGlue matcher integration  
- `keypt2subpx/` – subpixel keypoint refinement module  
- `test/` – unit tests
